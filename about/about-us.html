                <p>
                  Small businesses often rely on platforms like WordPress, Wix,
                  or Squarespace, which can be expensive and result in generic,
                  underperforming websites. These options lack customization,
                  scalability, and the ability to truly capture a brand’s
                  identity. Additionally, business owners are left managing
                  their own web operations—tasks that require time and expertise
                  they may not have. This creates a gap between affordability
                  and quality, leaving many small businesses without the
                  effective online presence they need.
